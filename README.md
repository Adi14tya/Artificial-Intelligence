# Towers Of Hanoi
~~~
Towers of Hanoi was invented and marketed in 1883 by the French mathematician Edouard Lucas.
It is associated with a legend of a Hindu temple i.e. Kashi Vishwanath where the puzzle was
supposedly used to increase the mental discipline of young priests. The Tower of Hanoi is also 
called Tower of Brahma. In the legend the young priests were given 64 gold disks stacked neatly
on one of three posts. Each disk rested on a slightly larger disk. The priests' goal was to re-create
the stack on a different post by moving disks, one at a time, to another post with the rule that a 
larger disk could never be placed on top of a smaller disk. Using mathematics, you can calculate that
even when the priests found the most efficient way to solve the problem, and moved the disks at a rate 
of one per second, it would take almost 585 billion years to finish the job. That is more than 40 times 
the age of the universe!
